# A Quantitative Look at Media Coverage of the Russo-Ukrainian War

For this project, I gathered data from The New York Times and The Guardian using their APIs to illustrate how the coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war has evolved over time. The project does not include scripts for API requests and data collection but only provides ready-made JSON files containing all articles.

I've gathered all articles containing the words "Ukraine" and "Russia." This means that some articles may not be specifically focused on the Russo-Ukrainian war but simply mention these countries in the text. However, given that the war was ongoing during the selected time frame and was the primary context shaping relations between these nations, I chose not to apply further filtering.

I've used [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) to build the main chart.
